Spinning up on CMAP for BIOS-SCOPE data

## Python
Using the pycmap package because that seems to be more current than the R package. 

Start with ``firstNotebook.ipynb`` and I can make some basic figures and learned how to setup the queries. Next up will be to gather data from different available datasets and match things up.
