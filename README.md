Spinning up on CMAP for BIOS-SCOPE data
Krista Longnecker, 14 June 2025

## Python
Using the pycmap package because that seems to be more current than the R package (and looks like other authors wrote the R package).

Start with ``tryingCMAP_v1.ipynb`` to learn how to setup the queries and make some basic figures, for example: 
<img src="https://github.com/redbluewater/tryCMAP/blob/main/example_figure.jpg" width="50%" height = "50%">

Next up will be to gather data from different available datasets and match things up.
