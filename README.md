Spinning up on CMAP for BIOS-SCOPE data
Krista Longnecker, 14 June 2025

## Python
Using the pycmap package because that seems to be more current than the R package. 

Start with ``firstNotebook.ipynb`` and I can make some basic figures and learned how to setup the queries. I can make figures like this one <img src="https://github.com/redbluewater/tryCMAP/blob/main/example_figure.jpg" width=10% height=10%">


Next up will be to gather data from different available datasets and match things up.
